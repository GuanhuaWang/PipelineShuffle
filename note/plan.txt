1. Make the scheduler happen before the ShuffleMapStage finished.
	in DAGScheduler.scala handleTaskCompletion()
		But we set the status of ResultStage to a new one, let's say isReady, as soon as the ShuffleMapStage is submmited.
		DAGScheduler submit ResultStage(call submitWaitingStages()) when it isReady.
		When the function submitStage runs, we modify the getMissingParentStages() to make the submission success.
		When call submitMissingTasks, we add a special status to the task.

	in Executor.scala
		When the task contains the special status we added, we should make it waitting. 

2. Change the fetch to push
	We should add a new Class like MapOutputTracker.scala into SparkEnv to record the localtion of reducers.
	Add a new Class extends ShuffleWrite with logging, which write the intermediate data to the reduce according the the location of map.
